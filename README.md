# Module 12  Belly Button Biodiversity
### by Terra Lasho 

## Summary: 

### Create an interactive webpage using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, for volunteer belly-button testers to enter their unique ID to retrieve belly button testing results (specifically the top 10 species). The goal is to provide a visual experience, including graphics -bar graph, bubble plot, wash schedule, and hover information.

## Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart

### For the first part of this Deliverable, I was tasked to create a bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) from a drop-down menu of volunteer IDs.  ID 940 is displayed in the dashboard of the dropdown menu, and the top 10 sample values are sorted in descending order. Also, there are values listed, and the out_ids are the labels.

### For the next part of this Deliverable, I wrote code to highlight in descending order, the OUT-Ids and the samples-values, as well as the bacteria labels when you hover on them.

### Finally, for Deliverable 1, I created a title for the Bar chart:

## Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart

### For the first part of this Deliverable, I set the axis, marker size, and hover text values for the bubble chart.

### I next completed the layout of the chart by creating a title, labeling the x-axis and creating the text when hovering over a bubble.

### Finally, for this Deliverable, the bubble chart successfully works, and user ID 940 is the default. All charts work simultaneously when a user is chosen.

## Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart

### For this Deliverable, I created a variable that filters the data to find specific information on an ID number, and then created a variable to hold the first sample  and then created a third variable to convert the washing frequency to a floating number. Finally, I did a trace object for the chart.

## Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

### For this Deliverable, I added a stock photo to the jumbotron, specific information about the graphs, and I changed the color of the bubble plot.
